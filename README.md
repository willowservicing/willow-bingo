# Let's play bingo!

Bingo is a game played on boards each with a 5x5 grid of numbers. Each number on the board is randomly arranged with the possibilities of numbers 1 â€“ 99.

For example, a board may look like this:
```
22 13 17 11  0
 8  2 23  4 24
21  9 14 16  7
 6 10  3 18  5
 1 12 20 15 19
```

The host draws numbers at random, one at a time. When a number is drawn, players will mark the matching number if it appears on their board.

A player wins the game if they have a row or column on their board with all of the numbers marked (no diagonals).

## Your Challenge: Find the first winning board, then calculate its score.

Write a script in `bingo.ts` that finds the first winning board. Once you have the board, calculate and return its score so that we can check if it's correct.

To calculate the score of a board, start by finding the sum of all unmarked numbers on that board. Then, multiply that sum by the number that was just called when the board won. Return this number.

## The Project Setup

* `bingo.txt` contains 99 random bingo boards, along with a random order of numbers that our bingo host has drawn. You can work with this data however you like.
* `bingo.ts` is where you will write your script to find the first winning bingo board. This file returns function (`bingo()`) that should output the final score.
* `bingo.test.ts` is where we'll check the return value of `bingo()` to see if it's correct.

_Things to note:_
* You may intake and format the bingo cards and numbers however you like, using whatever method you prefer. For example, you can hand-format the data into constants and paste them into the bingo file, or if you prefer to work with the file directly, we've included `fs` in the project.
* The project supports Typescript but you can use Javascript if you would like.

## Running it

* `npm start` runs the bingo file (`bingo.ts`)
* `npm test` runs the test file (`bingo.test.ts`) to find out if your answer is correct.
